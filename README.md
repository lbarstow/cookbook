# README

This is a cookbook website designed to allow users to share recipes and  add variations. The goal of this project was to create a cookbook where users could safely
upload and their own recipes with family without fear of their content being changed accidentally without their permission. Verified users are able to add variations to any
existing recipe without altering the original author's version.




The app is currently hosted at barstow-cookbook.herokuapp.com. This is a Rails (5.1.4) which uses React to render recipe content.
